This is a Reservation system with unlimited time and duration.
If you'v seen Arrot bueaty club repo, this one has more advanced features like :

# Rest framework
# Token Authentication
# React library for frontend
# Multi User types
# Full access to manage time period
# Admin panel for Vendor users


First, fill up some settings like SECRET_KEY and other settings.
Install node_moules or copy and paste it from existing one.

You have two servers for now : 
- first is Django on port 8000
- second is React on port 3000

If I add more features, I will mention it here.

Fuond a bug, send me a comment.
